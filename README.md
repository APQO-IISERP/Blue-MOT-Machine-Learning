# Blue-MOT-Machine-Learning
This program employs advanced machine learning techniques to optimize the number of strontium atoms in the blue MOT. Specifically, The Machine-Learning Online Optimization Package (M-LOOP) has been utilized for this purpose. For more information about M-LOOP, please visit https://m-loop.readthedocs.io/.

Optimizing the number of strontium atoms in a Blue MOT through machine learning involves several hardware components that may not be consistent across all users. As a result, it may not be feasible to create a generic code that can be used for all setups. Nonetheless, this code can be adapted for different experimental systems by replacing the demarcated snippets with a few lines that are specific to the given system.  

How to run this code?  

1. Install the M-LOOP python module from https://github.com/michaelhush/M-LOOP.
2. Download the file 'blueMOT_machine_learning.py' from the current repository and replace the demarcated snippets with hardware specific codes.
3. Run
